                  Jesus am I cold.

                  Still with us, Brett.

                                 BRETT
                  Yo.

                                 RIPLEY
                  Lucky us.

        They yawn, stretch, shiver.
        Dallas looks over at a flashing yellow light.

                                 KANE
                  I feel dead.

        Kane is not yet fully awake.
        Yawns.

                                 PARKER
                  You look dead.

                                 ASH
                  Nice to be back.

                                 PARKER
                  Before we dock maybe we'd
                  better go over the bonus
                  situation.

                                 BRETT
                  Yeah.

                                 PARKER
                  Brett and I think we deserve a
                  full share.

                                 DALLAS
                  You two will get what you
                  contracted for.  Just like
                  everybody else.

                                 BRETT
                  Everybody else gets more than us.
   
                                 DALLAS
                  Everybody else deserves more
                  than you two.

                                 ASH
                  Mother wants to talk to you.

                  I saw it.  Yellow light for my

        Above eye level the room is ringed by viewscreens.
        All of them blank.
        Kane, Ripley, and Lambert enter.
        Dallas' seat remains empty.
        All of them now dressed; they find their way to individual
        consoles.
        Ripley puts down the cat, straps herself into the high-
        backed chair.

                                 KANE
                  Plug us in.

        All three crew members begin throwing switches.
        The control room starts to come to life.
        Colored lights flicker.
        Chase each other across glowing screens.

                                 KANE
                  Give us something to look at.
                 
        Lambert presses a bank of switches.
        Viewscreens glimmer into life.

                  Take a look at this.

        On each screen, blackness speckled with stars.

                                 LAMBERT
                  Where's Earth.

                  Scan.
              
        Lambert hits several toggles.
        On the screens the images begin to drift.

        Lambert pores over charts.
        Consults her console.

                  you read me.  Over.
              
        Nothing but the hiss of static.

                                 RIPLEY
                  Nothing.

                  Found it.

                  Hard to believe.

                  here.
